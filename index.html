    <h1>Latitude vs. X</h1>
    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p class="parag">This is to show the relationship using data containing city latitude and comparing it to: humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. <br>
        The purpose of the project was to analzye the change in weather as the data gets closer to the equator. The data was extracted from the OpenWeatherMap API <br>
        and a dataset of over 500 cities was created. Using the dataset, MatPlotLib was used to plot city latitude versus multiple weather aspects such as: temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. <br> 
        This site provides insight on the data by using the source data visualizations that were created along with an explanation/description of the correlation and trend seen.</p>
